# Contributing to the Optimizely JavaScript SDK

We welcome contributions and feedback! All contributors must sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://docs.google.com/a/optimizely.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9cbouWptIpMgukAKZZOIAhafvjFCV8hS00XJLWQnWDFtwtA/viewform) to be eligible to contribute. Please read the [README](README.md) to set up your development environment, then read the guidelines below for information on submitting your code.

## Development process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from master.
2. Please follow the [commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) for each commit message. 
3. Make sure to add tests!
4. Run `npm run lint` to ensure there are no lint errors.
5. `git push` your changes to GitHub.
6. Open a PR from your fork into the master branch of the original repo
7. Make sure that all unit tests are passing and that there are no merge conflicts between your branch and `master`.
8. Open a pull request from `YOUR_NAME/branch_name` to `master`.
9. A repository maintainer will review your pull request and, if all goes well, squash and merge it!

## Pull request acceptance criteria

* **All code must have test coverage.** We use Mocha's chai assertion library and Sinon. Changes in functionality should have accompanying unit tests. Bug fixes should have accompanying regression tests.
  * Tests are located in the `tests.js` file.
* Please don't change the `package.json` or `VERSION`. We'll take care of bumping the version when we next release.
* Lint your code with our `npm run lint` before submitting.

## Style

To enforce style rules, we use ESLint. See our [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js) for more information on our specific style rules.
