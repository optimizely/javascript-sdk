#Contributing to the Optimizely JavaScript SDK

We welcome contributions and feedback! All contributors must sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://docs.google.com/a/optimizely.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9cbouWptIpMgukAKZZOIAhafvjFCV8hS00XJLWQnWDFtwtA/viewform) to be eligible to contribute. Please read the [README](README.md) to set up your development environment, then read the guidelines below for information on submitting your code.

## Development process

1. Create a branch off of `devel`: `git checkout -b YOUR_NAME/branch_name`.
2. Commit your changes. Make sure to add tests!
3. Run `npm run lint` to ensure there are no lint errors.
4. Run `webpack` to generate the built and minified file for those not installing via `npm`
5. `git push` your changes to GitHub.
6. Make sure that all unit tests are passing and that there are no merge conflicts between your branch and `devel`.
7. Open a pull request from `YOUR_NAME/branch_name` to `devel`.
8. A repository maintainer will review your pull request and, if all goes well, merge it!

##Pull request acceptance criteria

* **All code must have test coverage.** We use Mocha's chai assertion library and Sinon. Changes in functionality should have accompanying unit tests. Bug fixes should have accompanying regression tests.
  * Tests are located in the `tests.js` file.
* Please don't change the `package.json` or `VERSION`. We'll take care of bumping the version when we next release.
* Lint your code with our `npm run lint` before submitting.

##Style
To enforce style rules, we use ESLint. See our [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js) for more information on our specific style rules.
