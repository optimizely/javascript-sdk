/**
 * This module contains feature flags that control the availability of features under development.
 * Each flag represents a feature that is not yet ready for production release. These flags
 * serve multiple purposes in our development workflow:
 * 
 * When a new feature is in development, it can be safely merged into the main branch
 * while remaining disabled in production. This allows continuous integration without
 * affecting the stability of production releases. The feature code will be automatically
 * removed in production builds through tree-shaking when the flag is disabled.
 * 
 * During development and testing, these flags can be easily mocked to enable/disable
 * specific features. Once a feature is complete and ready for release, its corresponding
 * flag and all associated checks can be removed from the codebase.
