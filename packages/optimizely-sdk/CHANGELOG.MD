and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - September 26, 2018

### Fixed
- Track and activate should not remove null attributes ([#168](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/168))
- Track attributes with valid attribute types ([#166](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/166))
- Prevent SDK from initializing if the datafile version in invalid ([#161](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/161))
- Updating lerna to latest version ([#160](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/160))

### Changed
- Change invalid experiment key to debug level ([#165](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/165))

## [2.1.3] - August 21, 2018

### Fixed
- Send all decisions for the same event in one snapshot. ([#155](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/155))
- Give Node.js consumers the unbundled package ([#133](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/133))

### Deprecated
- The UMD build of the SDK now assigns the SDK namespace object to `window.optimizelySdk` rather than to `window.optimizelyClient`. The old name still works, but on its first access a deprecation warning is logged to the console. The alias will be removed in the 3.0.0 release.

## 2.0.0
April 11th, 2018

This major release of the Optimizely SDK introduces APIs for Feature Management. It also introduces some breaking changes listed below.

### New Features
* Introduces the `isFeatureEnabled` API to determine whether to show a feature to a user or not.
```
var enabled = optimizelyClient.isFeatureEnabled('my_feature_key', 'user_1', userAttributes);
```

* You can also get all the enabled features for the user by calling the following method which returns a list of strings representing the feature keys:
```
var enabledFeatures = optimizelyClient.getEnabledFeatures('user_1', userAttributes);
```

* Introduces Feature Variables to configure or parameterize your feature. There are four variable types: `Integer`, `String`, `Double`, `Boolean`.
```
var stringVariable = optimizelyClient.getFeatureVariableString('my_feature_key', 'string_variable_key', 'user_1');
var integerVariable = optimizelyClient.getFeatureVariableInteger('my_feature_key', 'integer_variable_key', 'user_1');
var doubleVariable = optimizelyClient.getFeatureVariableDouble('my_feature_key', 'double_variable_key', 'user_1');
var booleanVariable = optimizelyClient.getFeatureVariableBoolean('my_feature_key', 'boolean_variable_key', 'user_1');
```

### Breaking changes
* The `track` API with revenue value as a stand-alone parameter has been removed. The revenue value should be passed in as an entry of the event tags map. The key for the revenue tag is `revenue` and will be treated by Optimizely as the key for analyzing revenue data in results.
```
var eventTags = {
  'revenue': 1200
};

optimizelyClient.track('event_key', 'user_id', userAttributes, eventTags);
```
* The package name has changed from `optimizely-client-sdk` to `optimizely-sdk` as we have consolidated both Node and JavaScript SDKs into one.
