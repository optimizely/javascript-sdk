## Get Started

> For **Browser** applications, refer to the [JavaScript SDK's developer documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/javascript-sdk)â€¯for detailed instructions on getting started with using the SDK within client-side applications.

> For **React** applications, refer to the [React SDK developer documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/javascript-react-sdk).

> For **React Native** applications, refer to the [JavaScript (React Native) variant of the developer documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/javascript-react-native-sdk).

> For **Node.js** applications, refer to the [JavaScript (Node) variant of the developer documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/javascript-node-sdk).

> For **Edge Functions**, we provide starter kits that utilize the Optimizely JavaScript SDK for the following platforms:
> - [Akamai (Edgeworkers)](https://github.com/optimizely/akamai-edgeworker-starter-kit)
> - [AWS Lambda@Edge](https://github.com/optimizely/aws-lambda-at-edge-starter-kit)
> - [Cloudflare Worker](https://github.com/optimizely/cloudflare-worker-template)
> - [Fastly Compute@Edge](https://github.com/optimizely/fastly-compute-starter-kit)
> - [Vercel Edge Middleware](https://github.com/optimizely/vercel-examples/tree/main/edge-middleware/feature-flag-optimizely)
>
> Note: These starter kits use the **Lite** variant of the JavaScript SDK which excludes the datafile manager and event processor packages.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the SDK supports all of the platforms you're targeting. In particular, the SDK targets any ES5-compliant JavaScript environment. We officially support:
- Node.js >= 8.0.0. By extension, environments like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Auth0 Webtasks are supported as well. Older Node.js releases likely work too (try `npm test` to validate for yourself), but are not formally supported.
- [Modern Web Browsers, such as IE 10+, Firefox 21+, Safari 6+, and Chrome 23+](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es5)

In addition, other environments are likely compatible but are not formally supported including:
- Progressive Web Apps, WebViews, and hybrid mobile apps like those built with React Native and Apache Cordova.
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [Fly](https://fly.io/), both of which are powered by recent releases of V8.
- Anywhere else you can think of that might embed a JavaScript engine. The sky is the limit; experiment everywhere! ðŸš€

> \* Consolidated packages have been copied over and included as modules within the main `@optimizely/optimizely-sdk` package to avoid requiring maintaining and utilizing multiple de-coupled dependencies. (Related PRs [#749](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/749), [#755](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/755/files), [#761](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/761), [#781](https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-sdk/pull/781))

## Use the JavaScript SDK (Browser)

See the [Optimizely Feature Experimentation developer documentation for JavaScript (Browser)](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/javascript-sdk) to learn how to set up your first JavaScript project and use the SDK for client-side applications.

### Initialization (Browser)

The package's entry point is a CommonJS module, which can be used directly in environments which support it (e.g., Node.js, or loaded in a browser via Browserify or RequireJS). Additionally, for ease of use during initial evaluations you can include a standalone bundle of the SDK in your web page by fetching it from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@optimizely/optimizely-sdk/dist/optimizely.browser.umd.min.js"></script>

<!-- You can also use the unminified version if necessary -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@optimizely/optimizely-sdk/dist/optimizely.browser.umd.js"></script>
```

When evaluated, that bundle assigns the SDK's exports to `window.optimizelySdk`. If you wish to use the asset locally (for example, if unpkg is down), you can find it in your local copy of the package at dist/optimizely.browser.umd.min.js. We do not recommend using this method in production settings as it introduces a third-party performance dependency.

As `window.optimizelySdk` should be a global variable at this point, you can continue to use it like so:

```javascript
const optimizelyClient = window.optimizelySdk.createInstance({
  sdkKey: '<YOUR_SDK_KEY>',
  // datafile: window.optimizelyDatafile,
  // etc.
})

optimizelyClient.onReady().then(() => {
  // Create the Optimizely user context, make decisions, and more here!
})
```

Regarding `EventDispatcher`s: In Node.js and browser environments, the default `EventDispatcher` is powered by the [`http/s`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) modules and by [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#Browser_compatibility), respectively. In all other environments, you must supply your own `EventDispatcher`.

## Use the JavaScript SDK (Node)

See the [Optimizely Feature Experimentation developer documentation for JavaScript (Node)](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/javascript-node-sdk) to learn how to set up your first JavaScript project and use the SDK for server-side applications.

### Initialization (Node)

The package's entry point is a CommonJS module, which can be used directly in environments which support it (e.g., Node.js, or loaded in a browser via Browserify or RequireJS). Additionally, for ease of use during initial evaluations you can include a standalone bundle of the SDK in your web page by fetching it from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):

```typescript
import optimizelyClient from "@optimizely/optimizely-sdk";

optimizelyClient.createInstance({
  sdkKey: '<YOUR_SDK_KEY>',
  // datafile: window.optimizelyDatafile,
  // etc.
});

optimizelyClient.onReady().then(() => {
  // Create the Optimizely user context, make decisions, and more here!
})
```

Regarding `EventDispatcher`s: In Node.js environment, the default `EventDispatcher` is powered by the [`http/s`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module.

## SDK Development

### Unit Tests

There is a mix of testing paradigms used within the JavaScript SDK which include Mocha, Chai, Karma, and Jest, indicated by their respective `*.tests.js` and `*.spec.ts` filenames.

When contributing code to the SDK, aim to keep the percentage of code test coverage at the current level ([![Coveralls](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/optimizely/javascript-sdk.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/optimizely/javascript-sdk)) or above.

To run unit tests on the primary JavaScript SDK package source code, you can take the following steps:

1. On your command line or terminal, navigate to the `~/javascript-sdk/packages/optimizely-sdk` directory.
2. Ensure that you have run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to run all test files.
4. (For cross-browser testing) Run `npm run test-xbrowser` to run tests in many browsers via BrowserStack.
5. Resolve any tests that fail before continuing with your contribution.

This information is relevant only if you plan on contributing to the SDK itself.

```sh
# Prerequisite: Install dependencies.
npm install

# Run unit tests.
npm test

# Run unit tests in many browsers, currently via BrowserStack.
# For this to work, the following environment variables must be set:
#   - BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME
#   - BROWSER_STACK_PASSWORD
npm run test-xbrowser
```

[/.github/workflows/javascript.yml](/.github/workflows/javascript.yml) contains the definitions for `BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY` used in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline. When developing locally, you must provide your own credentials in order to run `npm run test-xbrowser`. You can register for an account for free on [the BrowserStack official website here](https://www.browserstack.com/).

## Special Notes

### Migrating from 1.x.x

This version represents a major version change and, as such, introduces some breaking changes:

- The Node.js SDK is now combined with the JavaScript SDK. We now have just one package, `@optimizely/optimizely-sdk`, that works in many JavaScript environments.

- We no longer support Node.js < 4.0.0, which collectively [reached end-of-life](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#end-of-life-releases) on 2016-12-31.

- You will no longer be able to pass in `revenue` value as a stand-alone argument to the `track` call. Instead you will need to pass it as an entry in the [`eventTags`](https://developers.optimizely.com/x/solutions/sdks/reference/index.html?language=javascript#event-tags).
