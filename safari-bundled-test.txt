  You can mark the path "chromium-bidi/lib/cjs/bidiMapper/BidiMapper" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle. You can also surround this "require" call with a try/catch block to handle this failure at run-time instead of bundle-time.
